                                    <h4>Healthy House Electrical</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The electrical rough-in for our healthy house was started after
                                        the roof was on enough to protect the wiring from getting wet.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The first step was to install electrical boxes for the following:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Outlets
                                        <li>Switches
                                        <li>Telephone
                                        <li>Cable TV
                                        <li>Computer network
                                        <li>Doorbells
                                        <li>Smoke alarms
                                        <li>Surface-mounted ceiling lights
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>
                                        Electrical boxes are usually a major source of air leakage
                                        in typical homes. To keep everything air tight, we used special
                                        air tight electrical boxes made by Nutech Plastics. These have
                                        one gasket around the edge that contacts the drywall, and another
                                        around the area where the wires enter the box. A small hole is
                                        cut in the second gasket to allow the wire to be inserted into
                                        the box. Then the hole is sealed with 100% silicone caulk to keep
                                        it air tight.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Although surface-mounted fixtures normally use a standard electrical
                                        box, &quot;can&quot; type down-lighting does not. We used a really great
                                        air tight can-type down-light from Juno
                                        Lighting that solved this problem. The following picture shows
                                        one of the lights installed in the ceiling.

                                        I originally wanted to run all of the house wiring in conduit.
                                        Several companies make armored cable (a type of &quot;pre-fab&quot;
                                        conduit), which is sometimes used in commercial applications.
                                        Most of that cable isn't air tight, though. A few companies do
                                        make an air tight version of armored cable, but it is pretty costly.
                                        There are two reasons why conduit is a good idea. First, it protects
                                        the wire from catching fire, and it prevents fire from spreading
                                        along the wires. Conduit also keeps the (strong) smell of the
                                        wire from getting into the house. It would have cost about $5,000
                                        to run all wiring in regular conduit. We decided we could save
                                        a little money by using standard romex instead. What we did was
                                        to buy the wire well in advance of installing it, to let it off-gas
                                        as much as possible. It turns out that the insulation material
                                        that we used inside the exterior walls and in the attic is fire
                                        proof. Because it was sprayed on in a semi-solid form, it surrounded
                                        the wire and provides a degree of fire protection. Finally, we
                                        are using foil-backed drywall to help keep any residual wire odor
                                        (and other odors from outside) from entering the house. Without
                                        foil backing, drywall is slightly permeable, and it is possible
                                        that a strong odor could seep through the material, especially
                                        over a period of months or years.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        To keep the romex from getting damaged, it is run through red
                                        plastic rings that sit inside holes in the steel studs. Our main
                                        interior junction boxes are shown in the photo below.

                                        To help minimize exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF),
                                        wire in the bedrooms was run only vertically where possible. Long
                                        horizontal runs would have made it difficult to avoid being next
                                        to the wires and their associated EMF. There is some evidence
                                        in the scientific literature that EMFs can cause or aggrevate
                                        immune system disorders, so it made sense to limit our exposure
                                        where possible.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We did something a little different with the telephone and
                                        cable TV wires. Instead of connecting each outlet to every other
                                        outlet, such as is done in most homes, a single wire was run from
                                        each outlet to a central electrical room. This gives us maximum
                                        flexibility. It would allow us to install a fancy video system
                                        later on, or a central telephone system with an extension for
                                        each phone, for example. We also ran wires from the doorbells,
                                        doorbell switches, outdoor sprinklers and ventilation controls
                                        back to the electrical room for tie-in to a future home automation
                                        system. Part of the wiring in the central electrical room is shown
                                        below.

                                        Here's a picture of the ductwork for our ventilation system.
                                        The ducts are bare aluminum, and are run through the attic space. They couldn't
                                        be run under the house, since it was built on a foundation. Bare aluminum
                                        was used to avoid the fiberglass insulation that commonly surrounds ducts.
                                        The ducts were insulated instead with an aluminized bubble wrap (not shown
                                        here).
                                    </p>

                                        The air handler and filter for the house is shown below. The
                                        filter uses a 3HP motor. It contains about 500 pounds of activated carbon,
                                        along with pre-filters and a final HEPA filter stage, so that it removes
                                        dust/pollen/mold, as well as chemical pollutants. Unfortunately, the filter
                                        ended up costing about $500/month (for electrical alone) to operate, so we
                                        didn't use it as much as I would have liked. The
                                        photo below was taken before the air conditioner was installed (it sits
                                        on the concrete pad, to the right of the stainless steel filter box). This
                                        picture was also taken before the filter was hooked up to the house. There
                                        are ducts running from each end of the filter, up to the two square connection
                                        points that can be seen just above the filter.
