<h4>Inositol Hexaphosphate (IP6)</h4>
<article>
    <p>
        Inositol is a B vitamin, and Inositol Hexaphosphate (IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub>)
        is a phosphorylated version of it, with six phosphates attached. IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> is 
        also called Phytic Acid or Phytate. 
    </p>
    <div class="text-center mb-3">
    	<img src="/Static/ip6-corn.jpg" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p>
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> is a naturally occurring substance found in grains, especially corn,
        and in legumes. It has several special qualities but one of the most interesting is its effect as an anti-cancer agent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inositol helps regulate cell division. It has a modulation effect which means that although it has no
        effect on normal cells, it stops the reproduction of cells which are multiplying too fast, such as cancer cells.
        It also forces the cells to mature and differentiate. Most cancer cells are immature, unspecialized cells that
        multiply indefinitely. Inositol can stop this. Actually, it is a phosphorylated Inositol that does the trick.
        Inositol Phosphate comes in six varieties from IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">1</span></sub> to
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub>. IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">3</span></sub> is
        perhaps the most active in regulating cell division, but the exact function of each IP is not known. Inositol is
        synergistic with IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> because as phosphates are stripped from
        the hexaphosphate they are taken up by Inositol, recycling the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> is the substance in fiber that prevents colon cancer.
        Also, studies in Finland show that eating a high fat diet along with a diet rich in this substance yields a much
        lower incidence of cancer (such as breast cancer), than countries such as the USA with less fat consumption.
        Inositol Hexaphosphate is among the most powerful cancer prevention substances known, even more so than Green Tea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inositol and its phosphate forms can also combine to defeat cancer that has already occurred. Malignant cells
        instantly absorb these nutrients, which can persuade them to convert to normal cells. Tumors given these
        nutrients tend to shrink and disappear. Regular chemotherapy destroys cancer cells and adds a toxic load
        onto the body as it attempts to clear cellular debris. Inositol and
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> do not do this. Chemotherapy (intentionally) dampens the immune system.
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> boosts the immune system, especially the Natural Killer (NK)
        cells that attack cancer. Cancer cells can become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. They cannot become resistant to the
        Inositol derivatives. IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> increases the activity of the tumor
        suppressor gene, P53 by seventeen fold. The P53 gene is reponsible for inhibiting the pathway that allows
        normal cells to become cancerous.
    </p>
    <p>
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> has been used against a wide variety of cancers.
        Blood based cancers such as leukemia are the most sensitive, with solid tumors needing a larger
        dose. Most studies at this point have used either animals or human cancer cells in vitro (in a test tube).
        As an example, adding IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> to human liver cancer cells
        resulted in complete inhibition of tumors. Human liver cancer cells injected into mice resulted in 71% tumors.
        Cells pretreated with IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> resulted in no tumors.
        Pre-existing liver cancers regressed. In another study with Rhabdomyosarcoma, tumors were suppressed from 25 to 49 fold.
    </p>
    <p>
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> and Inositol have other properties, too.
        They are strong antioxidants. IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> is also strongly
        anti-inflammatory. Asbestos given to rats resulted in lung inflammation and fibrosis.
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> reduced this by from 6 to 30 fold.
    </p>
    <p>
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> reduces the incidence of kidney stones in those prone to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also useful in cardiovascular disease. IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> inhibited
        platelet aggregation (stickiness) by 45% in rats. Platelet aggregation causes blood clots which cause heart
        attacks and stroke. Other studies with animals showed cholesterol lowered by 19% and triglycerides by 65%
        when IP6 was added to their chow.
    </p>
    <p>
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> inhibits hemoglobin S, the agent that is responsible for
        sickle cell anemia. This is the only known substance which affects the source of sickle cell anemia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inositol prevents fatty liver, prevents and treats the neural complications of diabetes, is an antidepressant (at high doses)
        and helps obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks (also at high doses).
    </p>

    <strong>CAUTIONS</strong>
    <p>
        IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> is nontoxic. However, phytates are known to interfere with the
        absorption of zinc. For that reason, I suggest taking 15mg to 30mg of zinc with it. If you supplement for an extended
        time, blood mineral testing is also warranted (ideally, RBC minerals; serum zinc at a minimum).
    </p>
    <strong>DOSE</strong>
    <p>
        The effects of IP<sub><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></sub> are dose dependent. For daily prevention, 
        1 or 2 capsules (500mg each) per day is sufficient. Those at high risk for cancer, fatty liver, 
        kidney stones, etc. should take from 2 to 4 per day in two divided doses. Anyone with an active case of cancer should take from 
        5 to 8 capsules per day in two divided doses. Doses should be taken on an empty stomach.
    </p>
    <strong>BRANDS</strong>
    <p>I recommend <a href="https://iherb.co/4t3scKEP">Jarrow's IP6, Inositol Hexaphosphate 500mg caps</a>. For Zinc,
    I like <a href="https://iherb.co/h2RzgB4">Thorne's Zinc Picolinate, 15mg caps</a>.</p>
