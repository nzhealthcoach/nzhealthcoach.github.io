                                    <h4>Healthy House Floorplan</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The final design for our healthy house
                                        was for 3,200 square feet with 3 &quot;official&quot; bedrooms
                                        and 2 1/2 baths. You enter the house from the north into a large
                                        foyer. The foyer is at the base of a large &quot;tower&quot; that
                                        has a 17 foot high ceiling. Windows at the top of the tower let
                                        in light to provide an airy, open feeling. The bedrooms are on
                                        the west side, and the kitchen is on the east. The garage is also
                                        on the east side, and is connected to the house by a 12 foot long
                                        covered breezeway. There is a door at the end of the breezeway
                                        that enters near the kitchen into a mudroom. The mudroom has a
                                        bench, a few cabinets, and a small sink. The idea is that if you
                                        need to come into the house without cleaning up first, you enter
                                        through the mudroom, and clean up there. A photo of the mudroom
                                        area is shown below.

                                    <p>
                                        The kitchen area is next to the
                                        family room, in a &quot;great room&quot; arrangement. There is
                                        a small breakfast nook at the southeast corner of the building.
                                        West of the family room is the project room. They are attached
                                        with double glass doors. Walking through the project room, you
                                        can go into the back yard, again through double glass patio doors.
                                        At the north end of the project room is the electrical closet
                                        and a storage closet. There is also a door that exits into the
                                        foyer.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Heading west from the foyer down the hall, the office is on
                                        your right side. Inside, it has a glass-doored area with a concrete
                                        floor that holds a copy machine, laser printers, and other similar
                                        machines. The ventilation system is designed so that fumes from
                                        that equipment are exhausted directly outside, and are not recirculated
                                        through the rest of the house. On your left as you keep moving
                                        west down the hall is the laundry room, followed by the guest
                                        bath. Then at the west end of the house are the three bedrooms,
                                        the master bedroom is on the left in the southwest corner. A small
                                        bathroom sits between the other two bedrooms. The master bathroom
                                        is on the south side, adjacent to the master bedroom, which also
                                        has a small walk-in closet. There is a sauna built into the master
                                        bath, along with a small toilet room and a large shower. A photo
                                        of the outside of the sauna is shown below.

                                        In keeping with <I>feng shui</I>, all of the ceilings in the
                                        house are flat. There are no slopes. The living room, family room
                                        and office pop up to 10 foot high ceilings. The rest of the house
                                        has 8 foot ceilings.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There are no fireplaces. Some homes near us have as many as
                                        five fireplaces. Since burning wood gives off large amounts of
                                        toxic chemicals, including formaldehyde and methanol, and because
                                        wood smoke is an important outdoor pollutant, and because of cost
                                        and the fact that a chimney would defeat our airtight goal, we
                                        decided to eliminate the traditional fireplace. In fact, we would
                                        like to encourage people who are building custom homes: If you
                                        do nothing else, at the very least you should be able to eliminate
                                        the fireplace. I feel that wood-burning fireplaces are an old
                                        custom whose time has passed.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The resulting house cost about 40% more than a comparable all-custom
                                        wood structure. However, not only is the house fire proof and
                                        termite proof, it will last at least twice as long, and it will
                                        provide us with an environment free of toxins and allergens and
                                        shielded against the respiratory irritation of common outdoor
                                        pollution.
                                    </p>
