                                    <h4>Healthy House Design Guidelines</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        After I developed MCS and had been engaged in treatment for some time, I realized
                                        I wasn't getting better. My research clearly showed how important it is to live in
                                        an environment free of mold, dust and chemicals. After looking around at potential
                                        new homes, it became clear that standard construction techniques were going to be
                                        a problem. We were committed to staying in Silicon Valley at that time, which ruled
                                        out moving out of the area. After further
                                        research into healthy home construction techniques, we decided to build a Healthy Home
                                        of our own.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The high-level requirements I came up with for the construction included:
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Non-toxic and allergy-free materials
                                        <li>Energy efficient
                                        <li>Durable, long lasting and low maintenance
                                        <li>Handicap accessible
                                    </ul>
                                    <br/>
                                    <center>
                                    <img src="/Static/front.jpg" />
                                    </center>
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <p>
                                        The specific design guidelines that had to do with the non-toxic,
                                        allergy-free nature of the house were the following:
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>Air-Tight Construction</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        Standard residential construction techniques result in buildings
                                        that allow a lot of air to come in from the outside, through various
                                        cracks, seams and other openings. Since this air would carry outdoor
                                        allergens indoors, it was decided to use air-tight building construction
                                        techniques, so that we would have 100% control over the quality
                                        of all air coming into the building.
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>All-Metal Building</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        Wood is normally used to frame the inside and outside walls
                                        of homes. I decided to use metal instead of wood because construction
                                        lumber is often treated with toxic chemicals, including formaldehyde,
                                        fire retardants and sometimes pesticides. Over the years, wood
                                        can rot, possibly exposing us to high levels of mold. Wood can
                                        also get termites, which normally requires treatment of the entire
                                        structure with high levels of pesticides. Because of my family's
                                        sensitivity to such chemicals, an infestation of termites would
                                        mean that we would have to move. It also turns out that we're
                                        sensitive to chemicals called terpenes that are present in wood.
                                        And finally, it's also nice that metal lasts longer than wood
                                        and that it can't burn.
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>Minimize Use of Plastics, Glues, Paints and Other Toxics</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        The fumes from most plastics, especially softer ones, have
                                        been shown in the scientific literature to have unhealthy effects
                                        on some people. Similarly, most glues and paints give off volatile
                                        organic chemicals that can linger in interior air for months or
                                        even years.
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>Minimize Places Where Mold Can Grow or Dust Can Accumulate</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        Because my wife and I are very sensitive to mold, we wanted
                                        to make sure that there were as few places as possible in the
                                        house where it could easily grow. This meant eliminating grout
                                        and other seams in showers or on counters where possible, for
                                        example. It also meant giving some thought to our closet spaces,
                                        to make sure they wouldn't turn into dust traps.
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>No Natural Gas Indoors</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        Natural gas and its combustion products are known to damage
                                        the immune system. Although some health advocates believe that
                                        cooking on natural gas is superior to electric, our doctor highly
                                        recommends that people do not have gas inside their houses. The
                                        reason is that gas appliances have a tendency to leak gas into
                                        the surroundings and to be inadequately ventilated.
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>Detached Garage</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        Cars give off all sorts of toxic fumes, from gasoline, lingering
                                        engine exhaust, lubrication oils, &quot;street&quot; grime, hot
                                        tire rubber, etc. Rather than letting those smells into the house
                                        every time we open the door to the garage, we decided to have
                                        the garage be detached.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>
                                        As with most people building a home, we also had a number of
                                        design guidelines that pertained directly to our own personal
                                        taste. This is the kind of thing that makes a house comfortable
                                        and livable. Although the house was to be &quot;clean&quot;, we
                                        certainly didn't want it to be &quot;sterile&quot;.
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            One story (no stairs is safer both for small kids and for
                                            older people)
                                        <li>Handicap accessible throughout
                                        <li>
                                            Use of the Chinese <I>feng shui</I> principals where possible.
                                            This is an ancient &quot;art of placement&quot; that has helped
                                            some people feel better.
                                        <li>
                                            A separate &quot;project room&quot; for the occasional smelly
                                            art project, and to store things we might want to keep that don't
                                            exactly fit in with the non-toxic nature of the rest of the house.
                                        <li>
                                            Home-run telephone and cable TV wire, in preparation for
                                            a later house-wide computer networking and home automation system.
                                        <li>Energy efficient structure and appliances
                                    </ul>
