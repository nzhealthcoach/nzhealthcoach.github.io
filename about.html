                                            <p>
                                                In the early 90s, I developed Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS). I was told it could be
                                                "managed," but wasn't curable. I didn't accept that.
                                                I had a background in biochemistry, so
                                                I began reading dozens of books and papers
                                                about subjects ranging from the immune system to detoxification and nutrition.
                                                I ended up spending several hundred thousand dollars on doctors, medical
                                                testing and specialized clinics. I flew from California to New York and Texas to see the best
                                                doctors in the field. I even snuck into a doctors-only conference. I experimented
                                                on myself with a wide range of treatments. Eventually, I went as far as designing and
                                                building a custom
                                                clean house from scratch with centralized filtered air and water, mold and dust free, using all
                                                non-toxic building materials.

                                    </div>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <div class="col-12">

                                                It took me 3 years, but I was finally able to reverse my MCS. In talking to others with
                                                MCS, I found I was one of the few who had success in doing that. Along the way, I learned what
                                                worked, and what didn't. Some treatments were cheap, easy and effective, while others were
                                                expensive, highly touted, and useless.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                A doctor and friend of mine, John Wakefield, once gave me some advice. I was living in California's
                                                Silicon Valley at the time. We were talking about the significant air pollution there and its effect on
                                                health, and he said,
                                                "don't wait too long to move." That thought weighed heavily on me for years. Then, in 2005, while
                                                on vacation in New Zealand, my wife and kids and I decided to make the jump. Such wonderful beauty,
                                                and good, healthy food and clean air by the sea. It was just a trial at first,
                                                but we ended up loving it, and decided to stay.
                                            </p>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <div class="col-12">
                                            <img class="mr-4 mb-2" style="float:left;width:280px;height:210px" src="/Static/paleo.jpg" alt="">
                                            <p>
                                                In 2007, not long after arriving in NZ, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Again, I was told
                                                it could be managed, but not cured, and again I didn't accept that. I followed the same process
                                                as before: intensive reading, research, and trial-and-error. It took longer this time, but after
                                                about 5 yrs, I was told I no longer have diabetes. Two incurable diseases cured!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                My health still wasn't perfect, though. I would often describe myself as "80% better," but I
                                                felt like something wasn't right. Then in 2016, I developed some new symptoms, and decided I needed
                                                to pursue my next phase of treatment more seriously. I began seeing a Functional Medicine doctor
                                                who is science
                                                and evidence based like me, and who is also open to discussion and new ideas. Together, we began
                                                the process of testing and the now-familiar trial-and-error treatments. I felt like I was making
                                                some progress, but it was very slow going. Then, after a series of tests,
                                                she diagnosed me with CIRS. That was a big turning
                                                point. After treatment began, I could quickly feel myself making progress again, for the
                                                first time in many
                                                years. I read and listened to everything I could find on the subject, and developed an
                                                in-depth understanding
                                                of Shoemaker's CIRS protocol and the science behind it. It was fascinating to me
                                                partly because it fit so well with my previous experience and knowledge. I am still on that path.

                                                Along the way through all of this, I became fascinated with alternative cancer treatments. There are
                                                a number of interesting overlaps between cancer and EI/MCS/CFIDS. Some of the same treatments are
                                                effective for both conditions. In addition to my extensive reading and research, I connected with an
                                                alternative cancer treatment clinic in Mexico,
                                                and learned a lot from them. A personal friend of mine got cancer, went to that clinic, and had
                                                some good success. I also continued to hear and read about people who successfully went into
                                                remission, and noticed a number of commonalities in their treatments.
                                                Immunotheraphy, for example, can be very effective,
                                                even in advanced-stage disease.
                                                For a while, I had a business
                                                where I researched the literature for people with cancer, and suggested alternative treatments
                                                that were backed by sound science.
                                                I can provide the same type of information now as a health coach.
